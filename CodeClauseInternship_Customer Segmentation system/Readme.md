# Customer Segmentation System

This repository contains code and resources for a Customer Segmentation System that utilizes K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. This segmentation can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and business strategies.

## Dataset

We have used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle for training and testing the segmentation model. You can access the dataset on Kaggle using the following link:

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory before running the code.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the correct directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.

## Model Details

We have employed the K-Means clustering algorithm based on clusters obtained from Elbow Curve method to group customers into distinct segments and then applied Machine Learning algorithms such as logistic regression,naive bayes to predict our segmentation accuracy. 

## Results

Upon running the code, one will obtain customer segments. These segments can be used to target specific groups of customers with personalized marketing campaigns and services, ultimately increasing customer engagement and business revenue.
