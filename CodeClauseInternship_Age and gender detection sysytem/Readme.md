# Gender and Age Detection System

This repository contains code and resources for building a Gender and Age Detection System using machine learning techniques. The system can predict the gender (male or female) and approximate age of a person based on input images.

## Dataset

We have used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle for training and testing the model. You can access the dataset on Kaggle using the following link:

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the dataset directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

## Results

The Deep Learning model is trained using 10 epochs.One can give more epochs in order to increase the accuracy and make their predictions more accurate. After training the model, one can expect accurate gender and age predictions from input images.
